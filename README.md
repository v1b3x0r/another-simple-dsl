DreamFlow : A PG-7 Rated Programming Language (Almost final but nope 🙂‍↔️)

DreamFlow is a language built on a simple starting point:
not calculations, not equations, not probability tables—
just answering one thing:

“How do you feel the world should work?” 😌

No right or wrong.
Just intuition, written down.
