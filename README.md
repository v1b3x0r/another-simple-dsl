# DreamFlow: A PG-7 Rated Programming Language (Almost final but nope 🙂‍↔️)

DreamFlow is a language built on a simple starting point:
not calculations, not equations, not probability tables—
just answering one thing:

> **"How do you feel the world should work?"** 😌

No right or wrong.
Just intuition, written down.

## How to Read DreamFlow

You only need basic English—
no grammar police, no strict rules.
(Not recommended for kids under 7, though.)

```
when {X}
    {always | often | sometimes | gamble}
    leadsTo {Y}
    >> {expansion}
    >> {expansion}
```

In human language, it simply means:

> "When X happens, it causes Y (always / mostly / sometimes / 50-50)."

## Examples of DreamFlow in Use

### 1) Real-world as Syntax

```dreamflow
when mountain.wind.hits("forehead") 
    sometimes leadsTo memory.record("this is why I stayed in Chiang Mai")
```

When the mountain wind hits your face, sometimes it records the memory that "this is why I stayed in Chiang Mai."

---

### 2) Home Behavior / Devices

```dreamflow
when env.humidity > 85 
    often leadsTo dehumidifier.wake()
```

When humidity goes above 85%, it often triggers the dehumidifier to wake up.

---

### 3) Social & Relationships

```dreamflow
when conversation.syncs.deeper 
    sometimes leadsTo reality.gains.resolution
```

When two people sync deeper in conversation, sometimes reality becomes clearer.

---

### 4) Maybe the World Has Lines Like This

```dreamflow
when humans.writeInPatterns 
    always leadsTo models.learnMeaning
```

When humans write in patterns, it always leads AI models to learn meaning.

---

### 5) Or Maybe Even This

```dreamflow
when meaning.accumulates 
    always leadsTo semanticLayer.spawn 
    >> emergence.evolve
```

When meaning accumulates, it always forms new semantic layers, which then evolve into unexpected behavior—guaranteed.

**Q: So… is DreamFlow a DSL?**

**A:** Yes—it's a DSL that refuses to stay in one domain.

It was born from one domain, but can be used in any:
- storytelling
- scenes
- physics
- behaviors
- anything that carries meaning
